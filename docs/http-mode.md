# HTTP mode: run coolify-mcp as a container inside Coolify

Deploy this server next to the Coolify instance it manages, then connect
claude.ai, Claude Desktop or Claude Code to it over Streamable HTTP with
OAuth 2.1. Nothing runs on your laptop, and your Coolify API token never
leaves the container.

This guide comes from a real deployment on a live estate, including the
mistakes we made. Claude Desktop's OAuth connector completed the whole flow
against it.

stdio remains the default transport and is unchanged. HTTP mode is opt-in,
and it is a bigger decision than it looks: you are putting a service on the
internet that brokers control of your infrastructure. That is the same trust
model as exposing the Coolify API itself, but say it out loud before you do
it.

## Install in five minutes

Everything happens in the Coolify UI. One environment variable selects HTTP
mode. There are no command overrides and no compose file to write.

1. **+ New Resource → Public Repository**
   - Repository: `https://github.com/StuMason/coolify-mcp`
   - Branch: `main` (HTTP mode ships on `main` since 3.0.0).
   - Build Pack: **Dockerfile**
   - Ports Exposes: **`8080`**
2. **Domain:** set one, **with the https scheme**: `https://mcp.example.com`.
   Saved as `http://`, the proxy never gets a TLS router and the site 503s.
   Do **not** put Cloudflare Access or another login wall in front of it.
   MCP clients cannot log in through one, and the server carries its own
   auth.
3. **Environment tab**, four variables:

   | Variable               | Value                                         |
   | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
   | `MCP_TRANSPORT`        | `http`                                        |
   | `COOLIFY_BASE_URL`     | See reachability note below                   |
   | `COOLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` | A **fresh** token, Keys & Tokens → API tokens |
   | `MCP_PUBLIC_URL`       | The domain from step 2 (bare domain is fine)  |

4. **Storages tab:** add a **volume** mounted at **`/data`**. Without it,
   every redeploy wipes OAuth state and all your clients have to log in
   again.
5. **Health check:** path **`/healthz`**, port **`8080`**.
6. **Deploy.** The log must end with `coolify-mcp http mode on :8080` and the
   app goes `running:healthy`. If it prints `cannot start`, it lists every
   missing setting with instructions. Fix them all in one pass and redeploy.

Verify from anywhere:

```bash
curl https://mcp.example.com/healthz
# {"status":"ok"}
curl https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
# JSON with "issuer": "https://mcp.example.com"
```

### `COOLIFY_BASE_URL` must be reachable from inside the container

The container calls the Coolify API, and the authorize page validates tokens
against it. If your Coolify dashboard sits behind Cloudflare Access or
another auth proxy, those calls hit the proxy and fail. Enable **Connect To
Predefined Network** on the resource and use the internal address:

```text
COOLIFY_BASE_URL=http://coolify:8080
```

A Coolify with no auth proxy in front can use its public URL.

### Coolify behind Cloudflare Access

If the internal-network route is not available (the MCP container runs on a
different host from Coolify) and your dashboard sits behind Cloudflare
Access, use an Access **service token** — Cloudflare's machine-to-machine
path. Without one, every API call 302s to the SSO page while `/healthz`
stays green, which took down our own reference deployment before this
existed.

1. In Zero Trust → Access → Service Auth → **Create Service Token**. Note
   the Client ID and Client Secret.
2. In the Access application protecting your Coolify domain, add a policy
   with action **Service Auth** that includes that token.
3. Set both variables on the MCP container:

   ```text
   CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID=<the client id>
   CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET=<the client secret>
   ```

The pair rides on every request to `COOLIFY_BASE_URL` — tool calls and the
authorize page's token validation alike — and on nothing else. Setting one
variable without the other is a startup error. The secret is treated as a
credential: never logged, never echoed.

One more Cloudflare Access warning while you are here: Access in front of
the Coolify **dashboard** breaks Coolify's own websockets unless you exempt
them, and with Livewire down the UI's env-var Save can silently store
nothing. If you "saved" a variable and the container disagrees, set it via
the Coolify API instead.

## Or: have your assistant install it

Already running coolify-mcp over stdio? It can deploy its own HTTP mode.
Paste this at your assistant:

```text
Deploy the coolify-mcp HTTP container on my Coolify:
create an application from the public repo https://github.com/StuMason/coolify-mcp,
branch main, dockerfile build pack, port 8080, domain https://mcp.MYDOMAIN.
Env vars: MCP_TRANSPORT=http, MCP_PUBLIC_URL=mcp.MYDOMAIN,
COOLIFY_BASE_URL and COOLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN as I give them to you.
Add a persistent volume at /data, enable a health check on /healthz port
8080, deploy it, then curl /healthz and the oauth-authorization-server
metadata to prove it's up.
```

The reference deployment this guide describes was configured that way: the
domain fix, the health check, the volume and both deploys went through the
`application`, `storages` and `deploy` tools. Upgrades take the same path.
After a new release, tell it to redeploy the app.

## Connect your clients

Add `https://mcp.example.com/mcp` as a remote MCP server. The client
discovers the OAuth endpoints itself and registers by whichever mechanism it
speaks: a Client ID Metadata Document (the client's `client_id` is an https
URL and the server fetches its registration from there, through the same
SSRF guard as every other outbound fetch) or, for older clients, dynamic
registration at `/register`. There is nothing to pre-configure. If you ship
a client with a metadata document, its URL has to stay up: the server
re-fetches it hourly, tolerates a day of the host being down by keeping the
last good copy, and after that clients re-authorize.

- **Claude Desktop / claude.ai:** Settings → Connectors → Add custom
  connector → paste the `/mcp` URL. Your browser opens the authorize page.
  Paste a Coolify API token, done.
- **Claude Code:**

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport http coolify-remote https://mcp.example.com/mcp
  ```

  Then `/mcp` → authenticate.

## How authentication works

- **Your Coolify API token is container configuration**
  (`COOLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`), exactly as in stdio mode. It stays server-side.
  No client ever receives it.
- **OAuth 2.1 authenticates the human.** The authorize page asks for your own
  Coolify API token as proof that you have access to this Coolify instance.
  The container validates it against `GET /teams/current`, then discards it.
  It is never stored and never used to act. The page tells you to check the
  address bar before pasting: only your own server should ever ask for a
  Coolify token.
- The client ends up holding a short-lived, revocable MCP token bound to this
  server. Access tokens last 1 hour and refresh silently. Refresh tokens last
  8 hours, so someone removed from Coolify loses MCP access within hours.
- There is **no secrets database.** The `/data` volume holds dynamically
  registered clients and token hashes, nothing else. Clients registered by
  metadata document are cached in memory for an hour and never written to
  disk, so the volume no longer grows by one client per fresh connection.

Everyone who authorizes against a container gets that container's token
privileges. For a privilege split, run two containers: one with a read-write
token, one with `MCP_READONLY=true`.

## Destructive operations require a human

In HTTP mode the [elicitation guard](security.md#ask-before-it-hurts) fails closed. Destructive tools
(`stop_all_apps`, deletes, key overwrites) refuse unless the client supports
elicitation, so a human can confirm in client UI. Clients without elicitation
(claude.ai and Claude Desktop today) get the read surface and routine
operations like deploys, restarts and env vars, and a clear refusal on the
dangerous ones. The refusal is deliberate. A model filling in `confirm: true`
is the model confirming with itself, and that is not a control on an
internet-facing service.

### Running a fleet over HTTP

`COOLIFY_INSTANCES` works in HTTP mode exactly as in stdio; the
[fleet guide](fleet.md) covers the format and what changes. One rule matters
more here: **a fleet is one trust domain.** Proof of access at authorize time
is validated against the default instance only — proving you belong to the
default proves you belong to the fleet. Every instance in the list must
therefore belong to the same owner. An agency with a Coolify per client runs
one container per client; the isolation is the deployment, not the OAuth
layer.

## Troubleshooting: every one of these happened to us

**Container restart-loops, log shows nothing useful.** You are deploying a
pre-3.0 ref with no HTTP mode: the container starts the stdio server, waits
on stdin forever, fails the health check, and Coolify restarts it. Set the
branch to `main` (3.0.0 or later) and redeploy.

**`https://` 503s, `http://` 404s.** The domain was saved with the `http://`
scheme, so the proxy created no TLS router. Change the Domains field to
`https://` and redeploy. Labels only regenerate on deploy.

**Status stuck on `unknown`.** The health check is off, or points at `/`.
Set path `/healthz`, port `8080`.

**Log says `cannot start` with a list.** Exactly what it says: every missing
or malformed variable, with instructions. Fix the lot, redeploy once.

**Authorize page rejects a token you know is good.** The container cannot
reach Coolify. See the `COOLIFY_BASE_URL` reachability note. The token is
validated by the container, not by your browser.

**Every tool call fails while `/healthz` stays green.** The health check
never touches Coolify, so a green check proves only that the container is
up. If Coolify sits behind Cloudflare Access, see the service-token section
above — the wire signature is a 302 to `<team>.cloudflareaccess.com`.

**Clients ask to log in again after every deploy.** The `/data` volume is
missing, so OAuth state dies with the container. Add it under Storages.

## Security posture

- PKCE (S256) required on every authorization; `plain` is rejected.
- Tokens are opaque and bound to this server (RFC 8707). The state file
  stores SHA-256 hashes, never tokens. Every redirect carries the RFC 9207
  `iss` parameter.
- Refresh tokens rotate on every use. A replayed refresh token revokes the
  whole grant chain.
- Rate limiting on `/token`, `/register` and the authorization form. 5MB
  request-body cap. Receive timeouts.
- Every tool call is logged to stdout as one JSON line (client id, tool,
  time), readable in Coolify's log view.
- Secrets masking is identical to stdio mode. `reveal: true` is no easier to
  reach remotely than locally, and destructive operations are harder.
- Refuses to boot with a plain-http public URL unless
  `MCP_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=true` is set explicitly.
- The test suite logs in through the full OAuth flow with the official MCP
  client SDK and runs an MCP session against this server. A change that
  breaks a real client fails CI before it ships.
