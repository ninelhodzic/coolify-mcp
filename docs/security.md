# Safety and security

Two controls make it reasonable to point this at production: destructive
operations ask a human first, and secrets are masked before the model sees a
response. The [HTTP mode guide](http-mode.md#security-posture) covers the
additional posture of the remote server.

## Ask before it hurts

Destructive operations pause and ask **you**, not the model. The prompt states
the blast radius before you answer:

```text
EMERGENCY STOP: take down 12 running applications
(api, worker, dashboard, umami, scheduler, mailer, search, billing and 4 more)
across 3 servers?
```

In [fleet mode](fleet.md) every prompt also names the instance it targets.

### Two protocol eras, one guarantee

How the question reaches you depends on the protocol revision your client
speaks, and both are live in the wild.

On the 2025 revisions the server sends an elicitation request mid-call and waits
for your answer. On revision `2026-07-28` a server may not interrupt itself like
that, so the call is answered with "input required", your client asks you, and
it then retries the call carrying your answer. Same question, same blast radius,
two round trips instead of one.

The retry carries signed state so the two halves cannot be separated. Two things
follow that are worth knowing:

- **An approval only authorises what you were shown.** The summary you read is
  digested into that state. If the estate changes between the question and your
  answer — an emergency stop that said 12 applications when 14 are now running —
  the approval no longer describes the operation and it is refused rather than
  quietly widened.
- **Confirmations expire after ten minutes**, and do not survive a server
  restart unless `MCP_REQUEST_STATE_KEY` is set. Both fail closed: you are asked
  again, never waved through.

Confirmation is asked for on `stop_all_apps`, `redeploy_project`,
`restart_project_apps`, `system disable_api`, application / database /
service / project / environment deletes, the credential deletes
(`private_keys`, `cloud_tokens`, `github_apps`, none recoverable from Coolify
once gone), and `bulk_env_update` across more than three apps. Routine deletes
(storages, scheduled tasks, individual env vars, backup schedules) deliberately
stay unprompted: a dialog on every delete is how dialogs stop being read.
Deleting a resource spells out whether its **persistent volumes** go with it.
`delete_volumes` defaults to `true` upstream, so leaving the flag unset is the
destructive choice, not the cautious one.

Prompts are skipped where there is nothing to confirm: an emergency stop on an
idle estate, or a redeploy of an empty project, just runs.

This is progressive enhancement, not a new requirement: clients without
elicitation support (Claude Desktop, claude.ai) behave exactly as before over
stdio. Once a client does advertise support, a decline, a cancel or a timeout
all abort the call. In HTTP mode the guard fails closed instead: a client that
cannot elicit gets a refusal on the dangerous tools, because a model filling
in `confirm: true` is the model confirming with itself.

These tools also carry the MCP `destructiveHint` annotation, so on a client
that honours annotations **and** supports elicitation you may answer two
dialogs in a row: the client's own permission prompt, then this one. That is
the client's prompt plus the server's, not a bug. Allowlisting the tool in
your client removes the first and leaves this one as the gate.

Set `COOLIFY_MCP_ELICITATION=off` to turn the confirmations off entirely. It
exists for the case where a client advertises elicitation support but does not
actually implement it. Without it, every guarded tool would return
`could not confirm with the user` with no way to recover. It is an escape
hatch, not a normal setting.

**It only applies to the local (stdio) server.** HTTP mode requires a human for
guarded operations unconditionally, so setting this there does not unlock
anything: the guard simply refuses by a different route. An internet-facing
server that waves destructive operations through because the model asked is not
a control, so there is deliberately no way to configure one.

## Secure by default

The server makes requests to one host it was not configured with: in HTTP
mode, the URL a client presents as its `client_id` (a Client ID Metadata
Document). That fetch goes through the SSRF guard in `src/lib/ssrf.ts`
(public addresses only, pinned DNS, no redirects, size and time caps), is
rate-limited per IP, and reports one generic sentence on failure so the
authorize page cannot be used to probe other hosts.

Secrets are masked at the API boundary. A client granted "list" access never
sees plaintext credentials unless you explicitly opt in with `reveal: true`:

- **`env_vars`**: variable values return as `***`. `reveal: true` is accepted
  only with an exact `key`; the tool then returns only that matching row.
  Bulk plaintext reads of every variable are rejected. Coolify exposes env
  vars through a collection endpoint, not a per-variable GET or a `reveal`
  query flag, so the token must have `read:sensitive` access (and the required
  owner/admin role on newer versions). If the API omits both value fields, the
  tool returns a capability error instead of claiming the value was revealed.
- **`system list_resources` (full mode)**: webhook HMAC secrets, basic-auth
  and database passwords, `internal/external_db_url` connection strings,
  compose bodies, Traefik labels, nested env vars.
- **`get_database` / `get_service`**: the same credential fields are masked on
  the detail endpoints, and any embedded server row is projected down to
  uuid/name/ip so its sentinel token and log-drain config never leave the
  client.
- **`get_server`**: sentinel and log-drain credentials are always masked, with
  no reveal.
- **`private_keys`**: key material is never returned, with no reveal; name,
  fingerprint and public key identify a key.
- **`deployment get`**: the raw upstream payload (server settings, log-drain
  tokens, webhook secrets) never leaves the client; responses are projected.

Log output (`logs`, `application_logs`, deployment logs) is wrapped in a
tamper-evident untrusted-data boundary with a per-call nonce, so a poisoned
log line reads as data, not instructions. The evals red-team suite regresses
this: see [evals/README.md](../evals/README.md).

## Rotating the token without a restart

`COOLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` is read once when the process starts. A stdio server is
spawned once per client session, and a subprocess never sees a later change to
its parent's environment, so rotating that variable does not reach a server that
is already running: the new token only takes effect when the whole client
session restarts.

That matters more than it sounds, because rotation is the remediation step for a
leaked token. The moment you most need a new token to take effect is the moment
the old design made you restart everything.

Point `COOLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN_FILE` at a file instead:

```bash
COOLIFY_BASE_URL="https://coolify.example.com" \
COOLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN_FILE="$HOME/.coolify/token" \
npx @masonator/coolify-mcp
```

The file is read at startup and re-read whenever its modification time changes,
so writing a new token into it takes effect on the next tool call with nothing
to restart. It is the same shape as a Kubernetes or Docker secret mount. When
both variables are set the file wins.

Two details worth knowing:

- **A trailing newline is stripped.** `echo token > file` appends one, and a
  bearer header carrying a newline is rejected as malformed rather than as a bad
  token, which sends people hunting a permissions problem they do not have.
- **A `401` triggers exactly one retry**, and only when re-reading the file
  actually produced a different token. A rotation that lands mid-call recovers
  instead of surfacing an error; a genuinely invalid token still fails on the
  first call rather than doubling every failure.

`doctor` reports which source the token came from, and for a file its path and
how long ago it changed. It never prints the value.

## Startup and doctor never print a secret

The startup self-check and [`doctor`](doctor.md) report variable names and
statuses, never values. Error messages that embed a URL have any
`user:pass@` credentials masked. Instance names, not tokens, appear in every
fleet error.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/StuMason/coolify-mcp/security/advisories/new)
on GitHub rather than a public issue.
