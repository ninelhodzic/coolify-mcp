/**
 * Where the Coolify API token comes from, and how it is re-read (#398).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A stdio MCP server is spawned once per client session and lives for the whole
 * of it. `COOLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` was read at startup and captured for the life of
 * the process, so rotating the token meant restarting the client session.
 *
 * That was named in writing as a reason for retiring this server in favour of
 * the official CLI, which reads its context on every invocation
 * (pedrorezendefig/hospital-reunioes#312). It matters more than it looks:
 * rotation is the remediation step for a leaked token, so the moment somebody
 * most needs a new token to take effect is the moment we made them restart
 * everything.
 *
 * ## Why a file, and not just the environment
 *
 * A spawned subprocess does not see later changes to its parent's environment.
 * Exporting a new value in a shell cannot reach a server that is already
 * running, so an env-only design cannot support rotation no matter how often it
 * re-reads. `COOLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN_FILE` points at a path, and the value is
 * re-read when the file's mtime changes — the same shape as a Kubernetes or
 * Docker secret mount, and what makes `coolify context set-token` style
 * rotation possible for us.
 *
 * The environment variable keeps working unchanged and stays the default.

 * wasteful, and caching without the stat would be the bug this module exists to
