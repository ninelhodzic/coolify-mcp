/**
 * Structured audit logging for tool calls (#370).
 *
 * Coolify's own MCP audit-logs every call and every denial. We logged one line
 * per *request* in HTTP mode and nothing at all over stdio, which answers "what
 * was asked" but not "what happened" — and "what did the agent actually do, and
 * when" is the first question a security review asks about an agent with
 * production credentials.
 *
 * ## What is in a line, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * Tool name, action, the resource uuids, the outcome, how long it took, and in
 * HTTP mode the OAuth client id. **Never arguments, never responses.** That is
 * not a style preference: `env_vars` create carries secret values in its
 * arguments, and responses carry everything the central sanitizer exists to
 * mask. An audit log that quietly became a second copy of the secrets would be
 * a worse leak than the one it was written to prevent, because nobody reads it
 * expecting secrets.
 *
 * Values are therefore never read out of arguments generically. `pickUuids`
 * works from a closed allowlist of identifier-shaped keys and validates the
 * shape of what it finds, so a new tool argument called `password` cannot end
 * up in a log line by being added upstream of this file. A future argument
 * genuinely worth auditing has to be added to the allowlist on purpose.
 *
 * ## Known limit
 *
 * A call whose arguments fail the tool's own schema is rejected by the SDK
 * before any code here runs, so it produces no line. There is no public seam to
 * audit from earlier than the tool callback without reaching into SDK
 * internals. The gap is narrow — nothing executed and no credential was used —
 * but it is real, and `audit.test.ts` pins it so that it fails, visibly, if the
 * SDK ever grows the hook that would close it.
 *
 * ## Defaults
 *
 * On in HTTP mode, off over stdio. A local single-user pipe writing a line to
 * stderr for every call is noise for most people, while a multi-client
 * internet-facing server is exactly where the record matters. Either default is
 * overridden by `COOLIFY_MCP_AUDIT=on|off`.
