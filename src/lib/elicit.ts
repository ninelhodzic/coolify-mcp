/**
 * Human-in-the-loop confirmation for destructive tools (#261).
 *
 * The problem this solves: `stop_all_apps` is gated on a `confirm: true`
 * parameter, and the model fills that parameter in. That is the model confirming
 * with itself before taking every application on the estate down. Elicitation
 * moves the question to the human, rendered by the client, outside the model's
 * control.
 *
 * **Strictly progressive enhancement.** Client support is uneven — Claude Code
 * and VS Code Copilot have it, Claude Desktop and claude.ai do not yet — so this
 * checks the client's advertised `elicitation` capability at runtime and, when
 * it is absent, approves and lets the existing parameter guards stand. A client
 * that cannot be asked is not a client that gets blocked.
 *
 * Failure is closed in the other direction: once a client says it supports
 * elicitation, a decline, a cancel, a timeout or a transport error all abort the
 * operation. The one case that does not abort is the blast-radius lookup
 * failing, because a summary we could not compute is a reason to ask with less
 * detail, not a reason to skip asking.
 *
 * V3 note: SDK v2 redesigns this as `inputRequired.elicit()` (#259). Everything
 * version-specific is inside `confirmDestructive`; call sites see only
 * {@link ConfirmOutcome}.

 * stateless HTTP mode, where per-connection capabilities are not kept, it
 * returns `undefined`, every guard approves, and the entire confirmation layer
 * disappears with no signal that it has.
 *
 * Failing open is the right default here, on stdio, where the alternative is
 * blocking Claude Desktop users out of tools that work today. It is very
 * probably the wrong default for a remote server reachable over the network,
 * which is the transport where the parameter-based guards stop being credible
 * at all — the reason #303 lists elicitation as a prerequisite. Decide that
 * deliberately there rather than inheriting this choice by accident.
 *
 * `COOLIFY_MCP_ELICITATION=off` is an escape hatch, not a feature. Once a
 * client advertises the capability every rejection from `elicitInput` aborts,
 * including `-32601 Method not found` — so a client that advertises
 * `elicitation` without implementing the handler, or a proxy that drops the
 * request, makes every guarded tool permanently unusable with no way out but
 * downgrading the package. The resulting error ("could not confirm with the
 * user") does not point at the client, which makes it hard to diagnose from the
 * outside. Rare, but unrecoverable, and the fallback is the same shape as the
 * one capability-less clients already get. The default is unchanged: absent the
 * variable, an advertised capability is trusted and the guards fail closed.
