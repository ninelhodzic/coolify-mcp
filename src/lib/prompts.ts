/**
 * MCP prompts (#371) — the guided workflows, as text.
 *
 * A prompt is not a tool. `prompts/get` returns messages that a client drops
 * into the conversation as if the human had typed them, so the directive voice
 * below is correct: the human is asking. Tool descriptions, by contrast,
 * describe a capability to a model that has not asked for anything, and stay
 * declarative.
 *
 * A prompt's arguments are interpolated straight into that user-role message.
 * The threat model assumes a human typed them, which is what picking a slash
 * command means — but the assumption is worth stating in a file whose opening
 * argument is about what may and may not occupy a user-role message. Nothing
 * here reaches an API, so a hostile argument is text in a message the human
 * can see, not a call they did not make.
 *
 * Three rules the text below follows, each with a reason:
 *
 * 1. **Never fetch on the client's behalf.** These builders are pure string
 *    functions and make no API call. `prompts/get` is synchronous, has no
 *    elicitation channel and no `_actions` affordance, so a prompt that
 *    pre-fetched would turn a slash command into a multi-second stall that
 *    can fail with an error the human cannot act on. Worse, embedding
 *    container or build output in the returned message would place
 *    attacker-influenceable text in a *user*-role message, outside the
 *    `asUntrustedLogs` boundary that the tool layer puts around exactly that
 *    text (FINDINGS #4). Naming the tool and letting the model call it keeps
 *    the log on the one path that frames it as data.
 *
 * 2. **Name only tools that exist.** Read-only mode (#303) does not register
 *    mutating tools, and consolidation puts two pure reads under destructive
 *    tools: `env_vars` list and `deployment` get. So a prompt that names
 *    `env_vars` is naming a tool that is absent from a read-only server. The
 *    builders take a {@link PromptBuildContext} with `has()` and drop any step
 *    whose tool is missing; a prompt whose *whole* workflow is missing is not
 *    registered at all (see `requires` at the registration site). Structural,
 *    so it cannot drift the way a hand-maintained list would.
 *
 * 3. **Fleet mode names the instance in the text.** The `instance` argument is
 *    routing for tools, but a prompt does not route anything — it produces
 *    words. So the resolved instance name is woven into the sentences and
 *    into the tool calls the model is told to make, which is the only way the
 *    downstream calls land on the instance the human picked.
 */
