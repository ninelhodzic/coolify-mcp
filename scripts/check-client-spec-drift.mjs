/**
 * Client-vs-spec drift check.
 *
 * `docs/coolify-openapi.yaml` (the upstream Coolify OpenAPI spec bundled in
 * this repo) is meant to be ground truth for "does Coolify support X"
 * decisions. It drifts in two directions:
 *
 *   1. Upstream adds/changes paths we haven't pulled in yet.
 *      -> covered by .github/workflows/openapi-drift.yml (weekly diff of
 *         upstream against this vendored copy — there is no separate
 *         baseline file; the vendored spec is the baseline).
 *   2. `src/lib/coolify-client.ts` calls a path that the bundled spec
 *      doesn't document at all (upstream may itself be lagging, or the
 *      spec here is stale).
 *      -> this script.
 *
 * This is intentionally a lightweight, no-network check: it extracts every
 * path template `coolify-client.ts` passes to `this.request(...)`, extracts
 * every path key from the bundled spec's `paths:` section, normalises both
 * to segment lists (with `${var}`/`{param}` segments treated as wildcards),
 * and reports any client route that doesn't match a spec path by segment
 * count + literal-segment equality. Route params don't need matching names
 * — only position and literal segments matter.
 *
 * A documented allowlist covers endpoints upstream genuinely hasn't
 * specced yet (see ALLOWLIST below). Keep it small — it's meant to shrink
 * over time as upstream catches up, not grow.
 *
 * Known limitation: matching is HTTP-method-blind and params are pure
 * wildcards, so a client literal can satisfy a spec param in the same
 * position. This check catches whole path *shapes* the spec has never heard
 * of; it cannot catch a removed sibling of a parameterised route without
 * method-aware matching, which isn't worth the complexity for the known
 * cases. Those cases, kept here next to the matcher that masks them (they
 * cannot go in ALLOWLIST, because they *match* and would trip the
 * stale-allowlist error):
 *
 *   - `/applications/dockercompose` — removed upstream in v4.1.0 (#235);
 *     masked by `/applications/{uuid}`.
 *   - `/teams/current` and `/teams/current/members` — dropped from the spec
 *     in favour of `/team` (4.3+), still routed upstream as deprecated
 *     aliases and the only form that exists on 4.0–4.2 (#347); masked by
 *     `/teams/{id}` and `/teams/{id}/members`. See the CLAUDE.md gotcha.
